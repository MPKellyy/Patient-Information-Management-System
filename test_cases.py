from database import *

'''
HEADER:
this file is the test case document for this project. here i will define standard procedure as well as 
provide an example for us to follow. I will personally try to handle maintaining proper documentation as well
as actual implementation of testing functions.

USEFUL INFO:
database object is defined as 'db'

PROPER TESTING FORMAT:

preamble:
here you will define what the test function is supposed to be testing, and what it's expected output is, as well
as any other useful information regarding the function
    def function():
        function here

post:
here you will define a list of testing history and results. nothing super detailed needs to be here, if output is
wrong or an error, describe the issue briefly. if the expected output is achieved, note it.
do not include unexpected output or errors not directly tied to the tested functions.
