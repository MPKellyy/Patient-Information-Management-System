HEADER:
This file compiles ALL repo test cases into one document. Whenever a test case file is added to repo, you MUST import
it above.

USEFUL INFO:
Simply run this file and let Pycharm handle the rest! Make sure to check the console once testing is complete!
If you run into a fail case, go to the test file in question and run the cases there for further debugging.

Post:
All 10 cases PASS as of 4/14/2023
